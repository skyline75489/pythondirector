Lots and lots more documentation

Don't need asynchat any more - switch the Receiver and Sender to use
asyncore.dispatcher, instead.

Admin interface bits left to do:

  Information:
    config / config.txt 
    running.xml
  Host mgmt:
    delHost
    delAllHosts
  group mgmt:
    changeScheduler?service=NNN&group=NNN&scheduler=NNN
  user mgmt:
    ??
  service mgmt:
    ??
  config management:
    save?
  other
    shutdown?
    explicitly mark a host as up
    mark a host as administratively up/down

Document the various return results from the text mode interfaces - 
eg running.txt

Experiment with andy dustman's C code replacement for asyncore.poll()

additional schedulers.

better testing stuff in SchedulerManager, rather than just dropping the
dead entry back into the mix. In the case of "it's down", this is harmless,
but nonetheless.

expires on the CSS.

'sticky' connections. keep a cache of 'client_ip':'backend_ip'. 

seriously refactor the CSS and also the pdadmin_running HTML. Nasty nasty.

pid file?

specify users not in the config.xml file, but somewhere else.

what does 'host unknown' raise under 2.1?
