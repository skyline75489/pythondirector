Don't need asynchat any more - switch the Receiver and Sender to use
asyncore.dispatcher, instead.

Admin interface: 
  Information:
    config / config.txt 
    running.xml
  Host mgmt:
    delHost
    delAllHosts
  group mgmt:
    changeScheduler?service=NNN&group=NNN&scheduler=NNN
  user mgmt:
    ??
  service mgmt:
    ??
  config management:
    save?
  shutdown?

Document the various return results from the text mode interfaces - 
eg running.txt

Experiment with andy dustman's C code replacement for asyncore.poll()

additional schedulers.

better testing stuff in SchedulerManager, rather than just dropping the
dead entry into the mix.

expires on the CSS.

'sticky' connections. keep a cache of 'client_ip':'backend_ip'. easy :)

seriously refactor the CSS and also the pdadmin_running HTML. Nasty nasty.

pid file?
