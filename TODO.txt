Things to complete before 0.1:
   addUser
   delUser
   doco? 

Write a client that does the running.xml vs current config deltas.

Lots and lots more documentation

Don't need asynchat any more - switch the Receiver and Sender to use
asyncore.dispatcher, instead.

Admin interface bits left to do:

  Information:
    [maybe] config / config.txt ?
    [maybe] config vs. running
    [maybe] reload config, making changes
  Host mgmt:
    delAllHosts?service=NNN&group=NNN
  group mgmt:
    changeScheduler?service=NNN&group=NNN&scheduler=NNN
  user mgmt:
    addUser?user=NNN&pass=NNN
    delUser?user=NNN
  service mgmt:
    newService?service=NNN&listen=NNN
    newGroup?service=NNN&group=NNN&scheduler=NNN
  other
    closeLog
    retryHost?service=NNN&group=NNN&client=NNN
    mark a host as administratively up/down?
    [maybe] shutdown?

add a 'autorefresh' to /running

Document the various return results from the text mode interfaces - 
eg running.txt

Experiment with andy dustman's C code replacement for asyncore.poll()

additional schedulers.
'sticky' connections. keep a cache of 'client_ip':'backend_ip'. 
'weighted' hosts

better testing stuff in SchedulerManager, rather than just dropping the
dead entry back into the mix. In the case of "it's down", this is harmless,
but nonetheless.

expires on the CSS.

seriously refactor the CSS and also the pdadmin_running HTML. Nasty nasty.

pid file?

specify users not in the config.xml file, but somewhere else.

what does 'host unknown' raise under 2.1? 

Clean up all the logging. Logging now goes to a single place, but in
inconsistent format. Still, it's better.

Track the count of faults.

If M2Crypto is installed, allow a https-based admin interface.
